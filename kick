Hi.

It's me again, the openSUSE activity bot. After two emails we have not received
any response or been able to detect any sign of activity or ongoing interest in
the openSUSE Project.

Therefore, your status of openSUSE Member has been temporarily removed, and you
have been moved to the "openSUSE Members Emeritus" group, which does not have
voting privileges in openSUSE elections.

If you feel this is incorrect, or if at any point you decide you wish to return
to the openSUSE Project, then please DO NOT WORRY.

We'd be happy to have you back, and you only need to respond to this email and
your previous position as an openSUSE member will be reinstated in no time.

So thank you for everything you did for openSUSE project and hope to see you
around someday again!
