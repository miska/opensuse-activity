Hi there!

This is your friendly openSUSE activity bot. I wasn't able to find any sign of
your activity in monitored channels. Are you fine? Are you interested in
remaining an openSUSE Member?

As an automated bot, I am often confused if your current e-mail is not set in
your openSUSE Connect account[1]. Please login there and check that you have
the addresses that you use set. If you use multiple e-mail addresses while
contributing to openSUSE you can set them all in connect in addition to the
main e-mail that we forward your @opensuse.org alias to.

Here is a list of your known e-mail addresses:
@mails@

Even if my failure to detect any openSUSE activity is correct, don't worry, you
can just reply to this mail with whatever from *your known e-mail address* to let
me know you are Ok and interested in the openSUSE Project. This will maintain
your openSUSE Membership.

Regards,
openSUSE activity bot
