Hi there!

This is again your friendly openSUSE activity bot. I still haven't received any
response to my last mail to you. Or maybe you used mail address I don't know is
yours? I hope I haven't offended you in any way and you still want to be
friends and part of the awesome openSUSE Members. Please, let me know you are
ok! Otherwise I would assume the worse - that you are no longer interested in
openSUSE and will retire your account. But don't worry, you can still get your
membership status back if you change your mind anytime in the future by simply
mailing me (from e-mail I have associated with you).
